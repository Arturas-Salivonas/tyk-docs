The social provider for the Tyk Identity Broker is a thin wrapper around the excellent `goth` social auth library, modified slightly to work with a multi-tenant structure.

The social provider should provide seamless integration with:
- Bitbucket
- Digital Ocean
- Dropbox
- GitHub
- Google+
- Linkedin
- Twitter
- Salesforce

The social provider is ideal for SSO-style logins for the Dashboard or for the Portal. For certain providers (mainly Google+), where email addresses are returned as part of the user data, a constraint can be added to validate the users domain. This is useful for Google For Business Apps users that want to grant access to the Dashboard for their domain users.

Check out [this section]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/integrate" >}}) for SSO deployment examples.

### Configuring your Social IdP in Tyk Dashboard

In short, all you need to do is as follow:

1. Access the **Identity Manager** under System Management in the Tyk Dashboard
2. Create a profile for your preferred IdP
3. Get the `client_id` + `secret` that are defined on your IdP
4. Set the `Callback URL` generated by Tyk on your IdP
5. Provide your SSO profile in Tyk with the `Discover URL (well known endpoint)`
6. Visit the Login URL after saving your profile to initialize the login
7. More documentation of the flow can be found on our [GitHub TIB repo README](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-identity-broker)
