In order to configure Tyk API Gateway to front your API backend service, you need to create an API definition in Tyk. This API definition instructs Tyk what to do.
It means that, oce loaded, Tyk Gateway will start listening to the path you provided in the API definition and will accept connections. It will also do a set of actions and run MW according to the instructions defined in the API definition.
Tyk Gateway support supports two type of API definitions -
1. Tyk OAS API Definition
2. Tyk Classic API Definition
