There are two ways to configure Tyk Gateway with an API definition:

1. Create an API with the Tyk Gateway API - Tyk Gateway has its own APIs which provides various services including the registering of Tyk API Definitions on the Gateway.
2. Create an API in File-based Mode - alternatively you can create a Tyk API Definition in a file and then load it to the Gateway.
