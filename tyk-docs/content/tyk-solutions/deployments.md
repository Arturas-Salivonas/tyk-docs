MPL is a copyleft licence that is easy to comply with. You must make the source code for any of your changes available under MPL, but you can combine the MPL software with proprietary code, as long as you keep the MPL code in separate files. Version 2.0 is, by default, compatible with LGPL and GPL version 2 or greater. You can distribute binaries under a proprietary license, as long as you make the source available under MPL. This is just a brief overview of MPL, you should refer to the MPL licence in full and if you are in any doubt about how this licence impacts you, please contact us to discuss.

You can find additional FAQs regarding the MPL licence [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/).
